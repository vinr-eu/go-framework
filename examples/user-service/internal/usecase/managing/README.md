# Use case subject

A subject of a use case defines and represents boundaries of a business, software system, physical system or device,
subsystem, component or even single class in relation to the requirements gathering and analysis.

> Example: Managing is actually a `Use case subject` which groups use cases like `View user`

## Use case

Use cases allow to capture requirements of systems under design or consideration, describe functionality provided by
those systems, and determine the requirements the systems pose on their environment.

> Example: Create 1 function for each `Use case` and selectively implement the `handlerFunc` from `handler` package,
> based on their operation and parameters
